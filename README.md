# Credit Risk Default Prediction (Machine Learning Project) 

## Business Problem
Financial institutions must predict which customers are likely to default on their credit obligations. Incorrect predictions lead to financial loss and poor lending decisions.

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the probability of customer default using customer behavioral and financial features.

## Dataset
The project uses anonymized credit behavior data similar to real-world credit card risk modeling scenarios.

Due to size limitations, only a small sample dataset is included.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature selection
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training (XGBoost & Neural Network)
- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search)
- Model evaluation (AUC, accuracy)

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras

## Results
The model successfully identified high-risk customers and demonstrated strong predictive performance using AUC as the primary evaluation metric.

## Business Impact
Banks can use this model to:
- Reduce default risk
- Improve credit approval decisions
- Adjust credit limits for high-risk customers
